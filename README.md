This is a README for a program Word Frequency created in Ruby 2.1.1. In theory it should take a phrase and search for the number of times a specified word is in that phrase. It's a pretty neat idea.

In order to run Word Frequency you need to run bundle and make sure that you have the Sinatra server running and open in your browser.

Known bugs for this program as of 1/9/15: it doesn't actually work, there are dead ends everywhere, and there are many things that don't exist, but hey, I understand the concept of git now, so that's a thing.

Note to my future self: You'll laugh about this someday.
