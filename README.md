Word Frequency README by Heather Anderson

This is a simple app called Word Frequency created in Ruby 2.1.1. It will take a phrase and search for the number of times a specified word is in that phrase. This a very useful app for anyone unaware of how many times they "lol" in a normal sentence.

Setup:
In your terminal inside this project folder:

	gem install bundle

	bundle

	ruby app.rb
	 
	Go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser
	
	And theoretically...you should now be able to use Word Frequency!
	

Known bugs for this program as of 2/2/15: No known bugs.
